# Portfolio Project Proposal 
## Project Description and Motivation
My motivation for creating my portfolio is to showcase my abilities in software development. My portfolio will display personal information about me, projects I have built in the past, and contact information. 
## Prior Art
I got inspiration from different portfolios I have viewed. I want my portfolio to express my personality and to give people who view is a sense of who I am. I took inspiration from Tony Gines with how his navbar was position and how much white space there was. I also like Ali Spittel's portfolio with how simple yet colorful her page was. 
## Core User Workflows
 - Whoever visits my page should be able to to see I am full stack developer.
 - Whoever visits my page should be able to see I can see program in Python, Html, Css, SQL. 
## Tuesday-Thursday Daily Goals
 Tuesday: I will have the body of my website complete as well as the NavBar with Bootstrap. 
 Wednesday: I will add CSS to my project to improve the appearance of my site.
 Thursday: I will add media queries to adjust how different users see the page.
